<h3>Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:

Class inheritance diagram
Direct Subclasses
All Known Subinterfaces
All Known Implementing Classes
Class/interface declaration
Class/interface description
Nested Class Summary
Field Summary
Constructor Summary
Method Summary
Field Detail
Constructor Detail
Method Detail
Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.</h3>
